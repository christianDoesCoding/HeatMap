Goal: Develop an application that provides insights into the most common ticket issues across different time frames (daily, weekly, monthly) and categories (general, per company).
Stretch:
- Allow filtering by company, issue type, and time period.
- Provide visual representations of data (graphs, charts).
- Enable report generation and export functionality.
- Leverage Azure AI to explore the use of machine learning to predict future common issues based on historical data.

How will this be useful:
- We want a solution that provides a visual on our ticket insights, that can drive automation ideas/ proactive measures for certain clients

Visualize:
- one heat map with a square for each client
- Heat map with ticket category
    - Scope out further on this...
- insight on certain tickets categories that occur on days of the week
